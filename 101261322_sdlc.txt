DevOps plays a crucial role in modern software development, integrating development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams to streamline the software development lifecycle (SDLC). By promoting collaboration and automating key processes, DevOps ensures that software is developed, tested, and deployed efficiently and reliably.

In the SDLC, DevOps bridges the gap between coding and deployment, reducing the time between writing code and releasing it to production. This continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline allows for rapid iterations, faster feedback loops, and reduced risks. As a result, DevOps helps teams deliver high-quality software with greater speed and flexibility.
