 Learning DevOps is crucial in the modern Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it bridges the gap between development and operations teams, allowing for faster and more reliable software delivery. 
 By automating various processes such as testing, deployment, and monitoring, DevOps reduces human error, increases collaboration, 
 and ensures that software can be released to production more frequently. 
 This approach is particularly important in Agile environments where speed and flexibility are key.
  DevOps enhances the SDLC by promoting continuous integration, continuous deployment, and efficient feedback loops.
