DevOps plays a crucial role in modern Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) practices, 
improving both efficiency and quality of software delivery. Traditionally, 
software development and IT operations were handled separately, 
leading to longer development cycles, miscommunication, and deployment issues. 
DevOps bridges this gap by fostering collaboration between development and operations teams.
