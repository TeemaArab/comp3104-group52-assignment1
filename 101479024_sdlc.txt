DevOps plays a crucial role in modern Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) practices, 
improving both efficiency and quality of software delivery. Traditionally, 
software development and IT operations were handled separately, 
leading to longer development cycles, miscommunication, and deployment issues. 
DevOps bridges this gap by fostering collaboration between development and operations teams.

The importance of DevOps in the SDLC includes:
- **Faster Time to Market**: DevOps practices, like continuous integration and continuous deployment 
(CI/CD), enable teams to release features, updates, and bug fixes more frequently.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Developers and operations teams work together, 
breaking down silos and fostering a culture of shared responsibility for the entire process, 
from development to deployment.
- **Automation and Efficiency**: Repetitive tasks such as testing, deployment, and monitoring 
are automated, reducing human error and speeding up delivery.
